 # Server-Side JavaScript
Overview
- Node.js Re-Overview
- Web Server Example
- IP and Port
- HTTP Protocol
- HTTP Methods/Verbs

## What is Node.js?
### Node.js
    
    - Server-side JS
    - Open source
    - free
    - cross platform/memory efficient
    - easily serves as a web server using web protocols and technologies
    - thousands of third party libraries and code modules

``` 
  const http = require('http');
  const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
  const port = 8080;

  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello World');
  });

  server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
  });
  ```

  # Server Redundancy
  - Server redundancy refers to a measure of setting up backup servers to support a primary server. 
  - For example, a site hosted on a single network server without any backups is not redundant. A redundant or backup server is essentially a mirror image of your primary server

#  Breakdown: Code Modules/HTTPS
- The require() function includes the **http** code module into the current file
- `const hostname = '1237.0.0.1';`
- web servers use the TCP/IP protocol that includes an IP address to identify each network device
- `const port = 8080;`
- Web servers use HTTP/HTTPS for web communication
- HTTP uses ports for communication
    - ports are part of the underlying TCP and UDP communication protocol of TCP/IP
    - port numbers are listed for well known activities
- The web server HTTP protocol consists of requests (**req**) and responses (**res**)
    - a web server request, sent from a client to a server, consists a of a request method, or verb, that indicates the desired action
        - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, where GET is the default from the web browser

    - a web server response, sent from server to client, consists of a status code and a response
    - both requests and responses include header information for HTTP protocol specifics, such as the format type of the data being requested or sent
        - the request/response format Media type uses the MIME specification
```
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/HTML');
  res.end('<h2>Hello World</h2>');
});
```
- The example code uses the **createServer** method to create a web server that ignores any web server request specifics
- the example always responds back with a 200 status code standard for an OK HTTP response
- A node.js web server *listens* for requests on a specific IP and port
- the response to requests was already created using the **createServer** method
- the listen() method of the server objcet starts the request listening activity
- the third parameter of the listen() method is a callback function called upon successfully starting the listening activity

# Change MIME Type
- We can make a slight change to the web server code to support HTML encoding
    - surround the **Hello world** text with an h1 heading

# Request URL
- The web address (URL) consists of
    - scheme://host:port/path?query
- Scheme: Method or protocol to accesss a resource
- Host: IP/Domain and oprtion port: Location of a resource
- Path: Resource location on server
- Query string: Name and value pairs of information separated by & following ?
