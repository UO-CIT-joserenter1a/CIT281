# Lecture Overview

- ## Real World Objects
    - As humans, our world consists of 'things' for example
        - animate objects, such as people, plants, or animals
        - inanimate objects

    - These 'things' include
        - Properties
        - Behavior or action

    - Another perspective is to consider a person as a type of 'thing' and each person as an instance of a thing.

- ## Computer Objects
    - A popular programming concept is object oriented programming, or OOP
    - A basic premise of OOP is to mimic certain concepts of the real world within software
    - OOP Objects
        - include properties
        - include behavior and actions
    - We've seen many ways to create objects in JS

- ## Single instance objects
    - JS Objects can be single instance object
        - single instance objects are also known as singletons
    - We've created single instance objects using object literals
    ```
    const firstPresident = {first: "George", last: "Washington"};
    ```

- ## Multi instance objects
    - While a singleton is very useful, we might also want to have multiple instances of the same type of object
        - the Date object is an example of a built in object that has specific properties and methods that are beneficial

- ## Factory functions
    - A factory function is a normal function, or function expression, that accepts specific parameters and returns an object
    ```
    function createAnimal(name)
    {
        const o = 
        {
            name, 
            identify : () => "I am a ${name}";
        }
        return o;
    }
    ```

    - ## Constructor Functions
        - A constructor function
            - requires a special internal instance object called `this`
            - requires the `new` operator to create an instance
        - As each instance is created using the `new` operator, the `this` object represents the current object
        - multiple object instances have their own `this` object

    - ## Classes
         - Most OOP languages include the concept of a class
         - classes must be instantiated and initialized using `this` and `new` operators
         - Class and arrow function for internal method

         ```
         class Animal
         {
            constructor(name)
            {
                this.name = name;
            }
            identify = () => 'I am a $(this.name)';
         }
         ```
         - Class Expression with non-arrow function for internal method
        ```
        const Animal = class 
        {
            constructor(name)
            {
                this.name = name;
            }
            identify()
            {
                return 'I am a ${name}';
            }
        };
        ```
# Function and Lambda Expressions
    - Why do we caer about function expressions?
    - A lambda expression is blocks of code
        - That can be assigned to variables
        - That can be passed as function arguments
        - That can be returned from functions
    - Blocks of code in JS typically means a function
    - Functions in JS are known as first class citizens because they are lambda expressions
    - In other words, functions used as data are lambda expressions
    - Function expressions and anonymous functions make lambda expressions possible in JS
 # Object References
     - JS Objects, such as object, and array

 # Object Assignment
    - Assigning a referential data type,

# Deep Copy
    - A deep copy will copy the entire contents of one object to another object
    - The resulting new object will not maintain any links to any referential data types in the original object
    - To achieve a true deep copy
        - Use a third party library like lodash
        - use JSON

# Clone: Lodash
- Lodash is a JS utility library with hundreds of methods
- Not part of the standard JS Lib
- The Lodash name is from the fact that Lodash is typically defined within software as the underscore 
    - `const _ = require('lodash');`
- Lodash includes two clone methods
    - clone(): Perform shallow copy
    - cloneDeep(): Perform deep copy

# Clone: JSON
- Using JSON Methods, an object can be first converted to a JSON string, then parsed back into a new object
    - JSON.stringify()
    - JSON.parse()
