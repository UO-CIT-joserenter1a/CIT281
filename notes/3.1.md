# ES6/ES2015
Although first invented in 1995 and originally known as LiveScript, JS is officially known as ECMAScript as part of a worldwide standard for programming languages
Versions since 2015 were named using ECMA and the year
ES6 or ECMA2015 was the last year to use the ES prefix

# Destructuring
JS destructuring allows extracting data from an object data types (arrays, objects, and newer ES6 types maps and sets) into their own variables using a simple syntax

# Object property variables
Consider creating variables from the following object

# Object Destructuring
- Object destructuring uses curly brace object syntax on the left side of the equal sign to declare the variables and assign a value by matching object properties with the same name as the variables
- Const { first, last } = person;
- Variables can be renamed
- Const {aka: nick } = person;
- Or given default values if not defined
    - Const { middle = “” } = person;
 # Scope
    Why do we care about scope?
        # Modularization: Reduces code into smaller more manageable components
        # Complexity reduction, Smaller components means reduced individual component complexity
        # Encapsulation

## Let and Const 
- With the introduction of let and const, JS adds the concept of block level scope
- JS scopes can now be viewed a
    Global: Defined outside of any block level scope
    Block: Defined within a block using curly braces
    Functions
    Conditions
    Loops
    arbitrary/ad hoc blocks
# Reminder: We no longer use var to declare variables to control scope

# Node.js modules
    - Server side javascript using Node.js supports the concepts of code modules
    - A code module is code encapsulated within a single file, and exported for use by another file
    - Node.js uses the CommonJS module formatting system
    - Module file creates a module.exports object
    - Code file imports the module file using require() function and object destructuring

# Module Files
    -   A module file declares a single module.exports object listing exported properties

# Importing modules
- a module file is imported using the require() function and object destructuring to declare and assign exported items
- const {propValue, anonFunction, normFunction} = require('./module.js)
- only import the items needed from the code module
- the current path ./ can be modified to include the code module from different file locations
