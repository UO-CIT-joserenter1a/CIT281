- Static vs Dynamic
- Paths
- Fastify and Express
- Package.json
- Node Package Manager (npm)
- URL Routes/Paths
- Query String
- Nodemon

## Reading Files
- Node.js can read static HTML web files use the fs (file system) built in module
    - the `readfile()` method will return the contents of a file
- Node.js supplies two useful variables that relate to the currently executing js source file
    - `__dirname`: Path of the folder where the currently executing JS file resides
    `__filename`: File name of the currently executing JS file

- The directory information is required to find the file to read
- this callback function, written using the arrow function syntax, will be called when the file read is complete, successfully or with an error
- the `__dirname` variable does not include the trailing slash folder separator
    - the forward slash is used, rather than backslash, which in JS is the ESC character, would require two backslashes to unescape

## Static Content
- The previous examples returned static web page content for any web address (URL) that starts with the target IP

## Path and Method/Verb
- To respond to requests by path, we need to add handling for HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each path
- the easiest method for handling verb and path requests is to use a third party code module called Fastify
- Fastify isk nown as Node.js middleware
- Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects, and allow interruption of the normal node.js request response cycle

# Adding Fastify
- Fastify is not included with Node.js, and must be installed using node package manager
- The Fastify function is added as a code module using require,
